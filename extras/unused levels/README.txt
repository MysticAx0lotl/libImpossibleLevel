All of these have been ripped from the game files
- phazed.lvl was found in the res folder, I had to add the .lvl extension manually
- doom.lvl and ěšřčěřžč řžčřžřřč.lvl were found in editor/levels, they are byte-for-byte identical and are both broken versions of phazd
- ěšřčěřžč řžčřžřřč.lvl is unloadable without changing the folder name
