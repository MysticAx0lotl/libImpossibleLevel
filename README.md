Progress:
- Understanding level file format
- Reading level file
- Writing object data to mutable nodes
- Write level data back to file

To Do:
- Adding blocks, spikes, and pits has very strange behavior in certain scenarios (decompiled editor hints at an unused "alpha" property for objects, look into this more)
- Understand how custom graphics work (seemingly unused by the actual game)
